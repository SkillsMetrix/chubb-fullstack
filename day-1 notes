computational Thinking. 


to solve problems. -> ways to solve /tackle it


Pickup a problem -> multiple sols


computational Thinking>
 four key tech

1)decomposition ->breaking your app /problem into smaller manage parts

2) pattern reco->looking for simi among and within problems

3) abstraction-> OOPS

4) algorithm -> dev step by step sol of the problem


1) solving problems
2) optimizing Solutions
3) Automating the tasks
------------------
points and imp notes of algo

1) it should be defined clearly
2) algo should produce atleast one output
3) zero or more inputs
4) executed and finished in finite no of steps
5) basic and easy to perform
6) step started with a specific indention like "step-1"
7) thr must be Start and the final step like END


-----
Use Case ( To make a cup of coffee)

step 1 : Start
2 
3
4
----
step 11 : END
--------
Task: Swap two numbers with a third variable
Step:1 Start
Step:2 Take 2 numbers as input
Step:3 Declare another var as "temp"
Step:4 store the first var to "Temp"
Step:5 Store the sec var to the first var
Step:6 Store the "temp" var to the 2nd var
Step:7: Print the first and sec var
Step:8: END


------------
Find the greatest between 3 numbers

Step:1 Start
Step:2 Take 3 numbers as input say A,B,c
Step:3 CHeck if(A>B and A>C)
Step:4 Then A is greater
Step:5 Print A
Step:6 Else
Step:7: CHeck if(B>A and B>C)
Step:8: Then B is greater
Step:9 Print B
Step:10 Else C is greater
Step:11: Print C
Step:12: End




Check whether a number is prime or not


Step:1 Start
Step:2 Declare var n,i,flag
Step:3 initialize var
          flag<--1
	  i<-2
Step:4 Read n from user
Step:5 repeat the steps until i=(n/2)
     5.1  if remainder of n+1 equals 0
         
Step:6 Else
Step:7: CHeck if(B>A and B>C)

  Algorithm ---> PseudoCode (Eng language)-------> Program



if "1"
print response
 " i am case 1"

if "2"
print response
 " i am case 2"

-------------------------

pseudo code
Read num1,num2
Set multi to num1*num2
Write multi

-----------

Read isFive
if(isFive=5)
	write "your no is 5"
else if(isFive=6)
write "your no is 6"
else
write "your no is not 5 or 6"

---------------------
Read isFive
if(isFive=5 or isFive=6)
	write "your no is a 5 or 6"
else
write "your no is not 5 or 6"

----------
Read isFive
if(isFive is not 5 and isFive is not 6)
write "your no is not 5 or 6"

-------------
write a pc to print all multiples of 5 between 1 and 100(
including both 1 and 100)
