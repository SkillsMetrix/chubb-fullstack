Here are exercises on SQL INSERT, CREATE, and ALTER statements, along with solutions to help students practice:

Exercise 1: CREATE TABLE
Task: Create a table named Students with the following columns:

StudentID (integer, primary key)
FirstName (varchar(50))
LastName (varchar(50))
Age (integer)
Grade (char(1))


Exercise 2: INSERT INTO
Task: Insert the following records into the Students table:

StudentID: 1, FirstName: John, LastName: Doe, Age: 20, Grade: A
StudentID: 2, FirstName: Jane, LastName: Smith, Age: 22, Grade: B
StudentID: 3, FirstName: Alice, LastName: Brown, Age: 21, Grade: C
Solution:

 
Exercise 3: ALTER TABLE - Add Column
Task: Add a new column called Email (varchar(100)) to the Students table.

 
Exercise 4: ALTER TABLE - Modify Column
Task: Modify the Grade column in the Students table to allow a length of 2 characters (i.e., Grade should be char(2)).

 
Exercise 5: INSERT INTO with SELECT
Task: Insert data from the Students table into a new table Graduates, which has the same structure as Students.

 
Exercise 6: ALTER TABLE - Drop Column
Task: Remove the Email column from the Students table.

 
Exercise 7: INSERT INTO with DEFAULT values
Task: Add a new student to the Students table without providing a value for the Grade. Set a default value of 'F' for Grade.

 

Exercise 8: CREATE TABLE with Constraints
Task: Create a table Courses with the following columns:

CourseID (integer, primary key)
CourseName (varchar(100), not null)
Credits (integer, not null, check that it is greater than 0)
InstructorName (varchar(100))


Exercise 9: ALTER TABLE - Rename Column
